    <p><h5>Our beautiful, finished mandarin orange chicken dish!</h5></p>
    <p>This recipe I've never made before. I'm pretty sure I've never even tried it! I've only ever eaten orange chicken from Panda Express. That's the only good dish the Panda at my university makes. Although, my mom sometimes does make what she calls "hot chicken." That stuff's real good.</p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion or ½ medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 package Trader Joe's Mandarin Orange Chicken</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>Sliced green onions (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent. Add the chicken from the package of Mandarin Orange Chicken to the skillet with the onion and toss to coat the chicken in the oil. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring often.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the orange sauce from the package of Mandarin Orange Chicken to a small saucepan over low heat until hot.</li>
        <li>Combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and water in a small bowl. Add the mixture to the skillet with the chicken and cook, stirring and scraping the bits off the bottom of the pan, for about 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the hot orange sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice or your favorite veggies. Top with green onions, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And there you go! Trader Joe's Orange Chicken made even better! Never tried it but I'm sure it's good!</p>
