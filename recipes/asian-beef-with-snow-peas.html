    <p class="img-subtitle">Our beautiful, finished asian beef with snow peas dish!</p>
    <p>I do think I've actually had asian beef, but I don't think I had it with snow peas. There was a while where I was babysitting for a family where the mom was from a Korean family, and they often let me eat their leftovers, and the beef she made was incredible. Not sure if this is even remotely the same.</p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 pound beef round steak, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>8 ounces snow peas</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, rice wine, brown sugar and cornstarch. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a wok or skillet over medium high heat. Stir-fry ginger and garlic for 30 seconds. Add the steak and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until evenly browned. Add the snow peas and stir-fry for an additional 3 minutes. Add the soy sauce mixture, bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and simmer until the sauce is thick and smooth. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And that's it! Enjoy!</p>
